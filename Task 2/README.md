## AI and Test Coverage (150-word summary)

AI improves test coverage by automating the discovery, generation, and execution of high-value test cases at a speed and scale unattainable by manual testing. Machine learning models can analyze production logs, user flows, and code changes to prioritize the most critical paths, reducing blind spots and ensuring tests reflect real usage. Generative techniques produce diverse input data to exercise edge cases, complex state transitions, and negative scenarios that humans often overlook. AI-driven visual and DOM-aware locators make UI tests more resilient to minor UI changes, lowering maintenance and keeping more tests green. Risk-based selection dynamically chooses which tests to run based on recent diffs, dependencies, and historical failure signals, expanding effective coverage while keeping pipelines fast. Finally, autonomous test refactoring and flaky-test detection preserve reliability over time. Together, these capabilities expand breadth (more scenarios), depth (more states and edges), and relevance (closer to real behavior), delivering measurably higher and more durable test coverage than manual efforts alone.
